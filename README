What is python-messaging?
=========================

A SMS/MMS encoder/decoder written 100% in Python.

History
=======

Originally written by Paul Hardwick with some bits from Dave Berkeley's
pysms. It was imported in the Wader and MobileManager projects and quickly
became clear that a joint effort would be more beneficial for everyone.

In 2010, the superb python-mms package by Francois Aucamp was merged into
python-messaging to provide a complete SMS/MMS encoder/decoder.

In 2011, as part of a license clarification, Francis Aucamp was contacted
and asked if it were possible to relicence his MMS portions as GPLv2, he
responded:
"feel free to re-license the parts of the python-mms code you are using in
your python-messaging project to GPL v2; you have my full consent."
